# Welcome!

### This is the website I made on gitpod for the introduction to HTML and CSS course. It is designed to be responsive and readable on a range of devices. Best viewed on desktop. The last update to this website was: **07/03/2023**

- # Design

    - ### Colour Scheme
            The colours i have used are:

                - #fff5dd             (white for text)
                - #7e3f00ea;          (brown for text background)
                - #373e02             (green for entire website background)
                - black               (for text)
                - #5db86b             (light green for the underline when hovering over an element)
                - rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)    (nothing for the empty spaces)
                - rgb(72, 192, 17)    (bright green for the form text)
                - #48cc20             (bright green for the submit button)

    - ### Font
        - The fonts I have used are Josefin Sans (Font for logo) and Josefin Slab (Main font). I have used these fonts because they are available via an open source license and you're free to use them.

    - ### Images
        - The images are very important as they are the first thing to capture the users attention. The large first image captures the users attention with its striking detail. While the other smaller images show the insects in even greater detail.

    - ### Wireframe
        - The wireframe I have used can me found here ==> https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPudNOPw=/?share_link_id=2977017497


- # Features
    - Responsive on all device sizes.
    - Internal and external links.
    - Contains some useful info about insects

- # Technologies used
    ### Languages:
    - HTML5
    - CSS3

    I have also used

    ```
    python3 -m http.server 8000
    ```

    To run a temporary webpage where I could see the website in real time 

    ### Libraries & Websites used:
    1. Google Fonts
        - Google fonts was used to import the Josefin Sans and Slab fonts.
    2. Github
        - GitHub was used to store the project code and images after being written and tested in Gitpod.
    3. Git
        - Git was used for creating versions of my code by using commits that save the current state of the code and files on Github.
    4. Miro
        - Miro was used to create the wireframe for the website

- # Testing
    - The W3C HTML and CSS Validator were used to check and validate my code to make sure there were no syntax errors.
    The HTML validator can be found [here](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) and the CSS [here](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input).

    - I have tested every internal and external link myself.

    - I have also tested the website using the dev tool provided by google to make sure the website is responsive and nicely styled
