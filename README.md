# Welcome!

### This is the website I made on gitpod for the introduction to HTML and CSS course. It is designed to be responsive and readable on a range of devices. Best viewed on desktop. The last update to this website was: **07/03/2023**

<br>

- # Design

    - ### Colour Scheme
            The colours used on the website are:

                - #fff5dd             (white for text)
                - #7e3f00ea;          (brown for text background)
                - #373e02             (green for entire website background)
                - black               (for text)
                - #5db86b             (light green for the underline when hovering over an element)
                - rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)    (nothing for the empty spaces)
                - rgb(72, 192, 17)    (bright green for the form text)
                - #48cc20             (bright green for the submit button)

        <br>

    - ### Font
        - The fonts I have used are Josefin Sans (Font for logo) and Josefin Slab (Main font). I have used these fonts because they are available via an open source license and you're free to use them.

        <br>

    - ### Images
        - The images are very important as they are the first thing to capture the users attention. The large first image captures the users attention with its striking detail. While the other smaller images show the insects in even greater detail.

        <br>

    - ### Wireframe
        - The wireframe I have used can be found here ==> https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPudNOPw=/?share_link_id=2977017497

    <br>

- # Features
    - Responsive on all device sizes.
    - Internal and external links.

    <br>

- # Purpose
    - Contains some useful info about insects and links to sources.
    - It also teaches the user that there are different types of insects and how to identify them.

    <br>
    
- # Technologies used
    ### Languages:
    - HTML5
    - CSS3

    <br>

    I have also used

    ```
    python3 -m http.server 8000
    ```

    To run a temporary webpage where I could see the website in real time 

    <br>

    ### Libraries & Websites used:
    1. Google Fonts
        - Google fonts was used to import the Josefin Sans and Slab fonts.
    2. Github
        - GitHub was used to store the project code and images after being written and tested in Gitpod.
    3. Git
        - Git was used for creating versions of my code by using commits that save the current state of the code and files on Github.
    4. Miro
        - Miro was used to create the wireframe for the website

- # Testing
    - The W3C HTML and CSS Validator were used to check and validate my code to make sure there were no syntax errors.
    The HTML validator can be found [here](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) and the CSS [here](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input).

    - I have tested every internal and external link.

    - I have also tested the website using the dev tool provided by google to make sure the website is responsive on all devices. I have used the Iphone 12 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra to see how it can be seen on phones.

    - The website was tested using Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge

    <br>

- # Known Issues
    - On some smaller screen phones the navigation text gets pushed below the bar.
    - On some mobile devices you can scroll to the right.

- # Depolyment onto GitHub
    These are the steps I took to deploy my project on GitHub:

    1. Go to the Code Institute [gitpod-full-template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template)
    2. Press the "Copy this template button" and create a new repository and name it. [My repository for this project](https://github.com/Ryder72/Code-Institute-Website)
    3. Create an index.html and a style.css file
    4. Create an assets folder.
    5. Code the website and commit changes often, and give them meaningful messages as to show what changed throughout development.
    6. Commit the project on GitPod and synchronise it to make sure it is saved on GitHub.
